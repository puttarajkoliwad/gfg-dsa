Properties of Linked Lists:
- Non-contiguos memory allocation unlike Arrays
- Heterogenous Data-types
- Dynamic in size
- Easy insertion/Deletion

Drawbacks:
- No random access feature
- Not memory efficient: Pointers will need extra space for each node
- Not cache-friendly since not contiguous

General code structure of Linked Lists:
class LinkedList{
    Node head;

    class Node{
        int data;
        Node next;

        Node(int data){
            this.data = data;
        }
    }
}
